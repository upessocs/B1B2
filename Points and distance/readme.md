# Problem
we are given 2D coordinates of following points (0,1), (2,4), (3,6), and (7,7).

1. Store following data in python and write a function to determine distance between two points.
1. Write a function to estimate polar coordinate of any point.
1. Write a function that moves point and determines new position when movement is given

If point P
$$ d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2} $$
